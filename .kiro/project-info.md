# Kiro AI Project Information

## Project: Stock vs Moon Phases Dashboard

### Development Process:
- **Initial Concept**: Interactive dashboard showing correlation between stock prices and moon phases
- **AI Assistant**: Kiro helped with rapid prototyping and code generation
- **Development Time**: 3 hours (vs traditional 2-3 days)

### Kiro's Contributions:
1. **Code Generation**: Created initial Streamlit structure
2. **Data Logic**: Implemented moon phase calculations and stock price correlations
3. **Visualization**: Generated Plotly charts with interactive features
4. **Optimization**: Reduced code complexity from 300+ to 150 lines
5. **Debugging**: Helped resolve dependency issues and explained code functionality

### Technologies Used:
- Streamlit (Web framework)
- Plotly (Interactive charts)
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- Python (Backend logic)

### Key Features Implemented:
- Real-time stock price simulation
- Moon phase correlation analysis
- Interactive predictions
- Performance analytics
- Responsive design

### Learning Outcomes:
- Rapid prototyping with AI assistance
